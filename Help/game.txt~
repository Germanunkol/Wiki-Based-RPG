If you are the server, you have to write the story which the heroes will play through. Write a piece of the story (you must use the current Wiki-Word), then press enter. Then the clients have time to reply with actions. For example, you could write something about a chest, and the players could open the chest.
In the meantime, you choose a new follow-up word which the Wiki has provided for you. Once the players are done answering (or the time is up), you continue the story. Again, you MUST use the word you picked in your story. You must also incorporate the actions that the heroes have done.
