Choose a first word. This word will be the one where the story beginns (or what the story is about).
If you're unsure, you can try "Room", "Chest", "Monster", or "Dungeon". Or anything else, really. If there's no Wiki-Entry found for the word, it'll tell you so.

Clients:
Create your Avatar. Also, choose something that describes your character.
